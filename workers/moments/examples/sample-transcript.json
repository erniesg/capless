      "text": "With respect Minister, I understand the need for sustainability, but we're talking about premium increases of 20-35% for some age groups. Many families are already struggling with the rising cost of living, HDB conservancy charges, and GST increases. How do you expect them to absorb this additional burden?",

      "text": "I understand the concern, and that is precisely why we have put in place a comprehensive support framework. The premium increases will be offset by the enhanced subsidy calibration mechanism, the inter-generational risk-pooling optimization framework, and the progressive premium adjustment modalities that we have carefully calibrated to ensure equitable burden distribution across the demographic spectrum.",
